### Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin stands as the pioneering digital currency. Its breakthrough has spawned a myriad of cryptocurrencies and smart contract/blockchain platforms, yet developers venturing into the realm of Bitcoin apps face distinct challenges.

Unlike younger counterparts like Ethereum, Bitcoin wasn't designed with programmability in mind. The absence of smart contracts in Bitcoin's architecture fundamentally alters the approach to app development. In this landscape, simplicity is king, and limitations are plentiful. However, it's within these constraints that creativity and ingenuity are truly tested.

As a decentralized digital currency, Bitcoin operates with a very simplified set of computing capabilities, enabled by the Bitcoin Script programming language. This language is not Turing complete, meaning it doesn't have the ability to perform all possible computation tasks. In practical terms, Bitcoin Script is designed for processing simple transactions and cannot execute complex operations or loops, which are possible in Turing-complete languages like those used for Ethereum's smart contracts. This limitation is by design, prioritizing security and predictability in Bitcoin transactions.

Moreover, Bitcoin lacks any form of cloud services and cloud infrastructure, as it is focused on the single task of securing Bitcoin transfers. Fortunately, there are already existing supporting technologies that complement its capabilities. In this book, we will explore several of these technologies. As an example, we will present NOSTR, a decentralized relay protocol for openly publishing and consuming data. NOSTR stands out for its simplicity and its ability to facilitate decentralized social interactions and information exchange, complementing Bitcoin's infrastructure by enabling a wider range of applications beyond basic transactions.

This book is a pioneering effort in developing applications using Bitcoin as the core technology, building upon its foundational principles. Our goal is to demystify the process, providing insights and practical knowledge for those bold enough to explore this less-trodden path.

Another bitcoin-centric technology that makes a significant difference is the Lightning Network. Bitcoin has a limitation of 1 MB per block approximately every 10 minutes, which hampers its usability for micropayments due to capacity and speed constraints. The Lightning Network, a layer-2 technology built on top of the Bitcoin network, addresses this limitation. It enables transactions at a throughput comparable to conventional payment systems like Visa or Mastercard, thus making micropayments feasible on Bitcoin's infrastructure. This innovation significantly expands the potential applications of Bitcoin, allowing it to handle a much higher volume of transactions and smaller payment amounts efficiently.

In this book, we will utilize a variety of supporting technologies, focusing primarily on Bitcoin, the Lightning Network, and Nostr, to illustrate how it's possible to develop applications that align with the Bitcoin philosophy. This philosophy is deeply rooted in the ethos of open-source, demanding a mindset distinct from conventional startup thinking. In the Bitcoin community, success isn't just measured in terms of profitability or market dominance. Instead, it emphasizes a culture of shared development and open contribution. This reflects a strong commitment to the principles of freedom and autonomy, which are foundational to the Bitcoin ethos. However, this raises a pertinent question: How do individuals and entities involved in this space generate revenue?

- The most successful approach often involves building for-profit companies that provide supporting services. The key to monetizing in this environment lies in leveraging the 'first-mover' advantage: build and contribute to the open-source protocol, and then capitalize on this foundational work by offering specialized, value-added services. This strategy allows developers and entrepreneurs to earn revenue while adhering to the open-source principles and collaborative spirit of the Bitcoin community.
